      <h1>Welcome to Maze Runner...</h1>

      <p>You've woken up at the beginning of a maze. You have no memory of how it happened. You only know that you need to escape.</p>
      <p>Wait, something's coming back to you... You were studying... graph search algorithms?</p>
      <p>Yes, that's right... Wait, who are these other characters in the maze with you?!</p>
      <p>It can't be... your old nemeses: DFS, BFS, and A*!!! You must try to beat them to the exit!</p>
      <p>Use the arrow keys or WASD to navigate. Select your difficulty below.</p>
